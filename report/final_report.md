# Sales Data Dashboard - Final Report

## Executive Summary

This report presents the development and implementation of a comprehensive Sales Data Dashboard system designed to provide real-time insights into sales performance, customer behavior, and operational efficiency. The system consists of three main components: data preprocessing, backend API, and interactive frontend dashboard.

## Project Overview

### Objectives
- Create a robust data preprocessing pipeline for sales data
- Develop a scalable backend API for data access
- Build an intuitive frontend dashboard for data visualization
- Implement AI-powered anomaly detection and insights generation

### Technology Stack
- **Data Processing**: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Jupyter Notebooks
- **Backend**: FastAPI, Uvicorn
- **Frontend**: Streamlit, Plotly
- **AI/ML**: Scikit-learn, Isolation Forest
- **Data Storage**: CSV files (expandable to databases)

## System Architecture

### 1. Data Preprocessing Pipeline
- **Input**: Raw sales CSV data
- **Processing**: Data cleaning, normalization, feature engineering
- **Output**: Cleaned and processed data ready for analysis
- **Key Features**:
  - Missing value handling
  - Duplicate removal
  - Date feature extraction (year, month, quarter)
  - Categorical data normalization

### 2. Backend API (FastAPI)
- **Endpoints**:
  - `/sales_over_time` - Time-series sales data
  - `/sales_by_category` - Product line performance
  - `/sales_by_country` - Geographic analysis
  - `/top_customers` - Customer ranking
  - `/kpis` - Key performance indicators
  - `/order_status` - Order status distribution
- **Features**:
  - CORS enabled for frontend integration
  - Error handling and validation
  - Sample data generation for testing

### 3. Frontend Dashboard (Streamlit)
- **Tabs**:
  - Overview: KPIs and sales trends
  - Products: Product line analysis
  - Geography: Country-wise performance
  - Customers: Customer analysis
  - Analytics: Advanced metrics
- **Features**:
  - Interactive charts and visualizations
  - Real-time data filtering
  - Responsive design
  - Auto-refresh capability

### 4. AI Components
- **Anomaly Detection**: Identifies unusual patterns in sales data
- **Insights Generation**: Provides actionable business recommendations
